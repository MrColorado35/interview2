Web scraping with Python

While working on this project I was using the knowledge found in internet here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQgXKtPSzUI and here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-web-scraping-python-beautiful-soup/

Then, as I found out the website is protected, I had to slightly change my approach to the one that I found here: https://pythonrepo.com/repo/VeNoMouS-cloudscraper-python-web-crawling


So after quite a few hours spent on that task it gives back pretty much all info that we need.
For some reason while in VSC my .csv file looks alright, in Excell on my computer it displays set of weird symbols instead of 'dash' between opening and closing time.
Also, as span with 'Closed' on their website does not have their own class nor ID, I decided to make it 'hard way' instead.
