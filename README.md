Web scraping with Python

While working on this project I was using the knowledge found in internet here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQgXKtPSzUI and here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-web-scraping-python-beautiful-soup/

Then, as I found out the website is protected, I had to slightly change my approach to the one that I found here: https://pythonrepo.com/repo/VeNoMouS-cloudscraper-python-web-crawling

In order to maintain some order in my .CSV file I decided to mix horizontal and vertical layout, depending on data type. I belive it helps with readability.

For some reason while in VSC and GitPod my .csv file looks alright, in Excell on my computer it displays set of weird symbols instead of 'dash' between opening and closing time. I assume that it is because I only use free version of the program, with all it's limits.
Also, as span with 'Closed' on their website does not have their own class nor ID, I decided to make it 'hard way' instead.

Working on this project was very educative, as I've never done web scraping before.
I found it fascinating.
